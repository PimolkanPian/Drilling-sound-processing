# Introduction to Acoustic Monitoring for Drilling Operation
This project aims to develop a system that monitors the operational state of drilling machines using acoustic sensors by capturing and analyzing acoustic signals.
The system can detect variations in machine behavior, abnomality and enables in-situ process monitoring and machine health in process.

**Sound Library of Drilling materials**

An experiment was conducted to capture mechanical sound waves generated during the drilling materials while recording sound using a Logitech C920 camera.
Drilling was performed at two feed rates are 50 and 150 mm/min, three power levels are 60, 80, and 100 Watt and drill bit had a diameter of 2.4 mm.
The Acrylic, PTFE and Hardwood are available in thicknesses of 3, 5 and 10 mm respectively.
<br>
The experiment start with Power 60W at feed rate 50 mm/min. The drill moves down, press into the material and penetrates the material.
We observed the frequency that occurs and the power level was increased to 80W and 100W that observed high frequency, correlating with the increased force applied to the material.
